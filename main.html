  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of how the execution time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of speed as input sizes increase.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means it requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.
